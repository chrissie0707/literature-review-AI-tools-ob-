# literature-review-AI-tools-ob-
This tool is a Python-based assistant designed to help researchers quickly screen and analyze large batches of academic papers exported from databases like Web of Science (WOS). By loading CSV files with paper titles and abstracts, the tool uses AI to automatically identify which papers are relevant to your research field (e.g., Organizational Behavior), and then extracts key information such as research questions, findings, and variables. This automation saves you from manually reading through hundreds of papers, speeds up literature reviews (especially the initial screening and extraction steps), and might apply to the title screening stage of meta analysis..

# Features

- Customizable screening criteria
- Structured literature extraction
- Multiple LLM provider support
- Batch processing with progress tracking
